# Escape From Island
You and a few survivors are trapped in a heavily guarded island. You have to navigate through the places, find the keys and clues required to escape, while also rescuing other survivors alongside you.
Pick up a gun and ammo to fire against the guards. The gun, the keys and the clues spawn randomly every time.
There are 3 levels with different difficulties.
Your ultimate goal remains the same: enter the boat alive along with the survivors.
Controls:
E to interact (pick up/interact with survivor)
Left Mouse Button to shoot with the gun
TAB to open details (health, stamina, ammo count, etc.)
